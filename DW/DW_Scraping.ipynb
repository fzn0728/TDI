We'll be using CSS selectors, which are more common for HTML and easier to learn.\n",

    " - `'#myid'` picks out all tags whose _id_ is equal to `myid`\n",
    " - `'.myclass'` picks out all tags whose _class_ is equal to `myclass`\n",
    " - `'mytag#myid'` will pick all tags of type `mytag` **and** `id` equal to `myid` (analogously for `'mytag.myclass'`)\n",
    " - If `'selector1'` and `'selector2'` are two selectors, then there is another selector `'selector1 selector2'`.  It picks out all tags satisfying `selector2` that are __descendents__(*) of something satisfying `selector1`, i.e. it's like our nested find.\n",
    " \n",
    " (*) It doesn't have to be a _direct_ descendent.  I.e. it can be a grand-grand-...-grand-child of something satisfying `selector1`.  For direct descendents we'd instead write `'selector1 > selector2'`\n",

    "1. Additional scraping steps (e.g. scraping entries in a directory like in the example above) can be accessed via `scrapy.Request`.\n",

If we were to run the above test twice, we'd probably find that some of the failures were just due to a connection error.  We didn't notice this because the _outer_ `try` / `except` is also catching these.  So: Modify `get_tech_details` to allow up to 3 retries. <br/>Bonus points if you actually look at what exceptions `urllib` throws in those cases instead of a general catch-all mechanism.  Alternate type of bonus points if you figure out how to do it using the `retrying` package.  You can test these by throttling your internet on and off to simulate an unreliable connection."
